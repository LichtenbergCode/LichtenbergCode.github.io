
## Introduction

Briefly explain what this section covers: 

* The porpose of the installation guide. 
* Supported platforms (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows, macOS, Raspberry Pi).
* Any prerequisites or assumptions (like Python experience or Docker familiarity).

Example:
“This section provides a step-by-step guide to install and configure the environment required to run the project. It covers dependencies, setup instructions for Linux and Docker, and optional configurations for hardware acceleration using the Hailo-8 module.”

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
Specify the minimum and recommended hardware:
* CPU, RAM and storage 
* GPU or AI accelerator (if any).
* Supported hardware platforms. 

Example:

* Minimum:

    * Quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 (Raspberry Pi 5 or equivalent)
    * 4 GB RAM
    * 32 GB storage

* Recommended:

    * Raspberry Pi 5 with 8 GB RAM
    * Hailo-8 AI module (optional for inference acceleration)

## Software Requirements
List all required software and their versions:

* Operating system.
* Required frameworks or runtimes.
* Recommended tools for development.

Example:

* Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (64-bit, ARM or x86_64)

* Python: 3.11 or higher

* ROS 2: Jazzy or Humble distribution

* Docker & Docker Compose: Latest stable release

* Git: ≥ 2.34

* Optional: Visual Studio Code, Tailscale (for networked systems)

## Environment Setup
### Update the system 
### Install Python and dependencies 
### Install ROS 2
### Docker Installation (Optional)

## Hardware Integration (if applicable)

## Project Cloning and Initialization

## Verifying the installation 
python main.py --test

## Troubleshooting 

## Next Steps
Provide guidance on where to go after installation.
Example:

* Proceed to the User Guide
 to learn how to run and control the system.
* Check the Architecture
 section for details about how modules interact.
* Explore the Features
 section to understand the main capabilities.
